## Description

> Challenge #12 Create a CMS using SQL and node.js

## Introduction 
The challenge this week is to build a command-line application to manage a company's database of employees using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Challenges

MySQL was such a challenge. I had issues with my mac not recognizing the SQL prompts because of a security issue, then not having SQL 1 deployed on my Package.json. The Syntax also go in the way with making sure it was perfect with all the many naming variables I had used.
